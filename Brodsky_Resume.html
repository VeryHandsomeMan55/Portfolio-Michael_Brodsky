              <br>
              <p>The Engineering Academy has been one of the best things that have happened to me. If it wasn't clear already, this is my work experience page and it shows the bulk of my experience in the academy. And these three years have changed me for the better. And I hope these paragraphs prove this. I really look forward to changing the world after high school.</p>

                  <p>One guest speaker that influenced me the most in the academy is probably Anthony Bagnulo from Tesla. After going to the University of Ottawa, he was inspired by a friend to go to Tesla Motors in 2012. After Tesla almost went bankrupt and some time looking for a job, Tesla came back and he became a part of it. He works in Manufacturing and Mechanical parts. If I learned anything from him, it's perseverance and have someone you look up to.</p>

                  <p>In addition, two more guest speakers that changed me were Shannah Withrow and Winne Kuag. They work with NASA and helped develop the Mars chopper, a new device that will make exploration eaiser on Mars. They both got out of school experiences with engineering. And they helped design and test aerospace equipment for NASA. If I got anything out of them, I learned that I should know my strengths, get out of my comfort zone, and communication is key.</p>

                  <p>Another speaker who influened me was Joanne Baek. She's in chemical and biomolecular engineering. After high school she was accepted by Hopkins on the east coast. And she's currently, in 2021, working on gene expression. And two things I learned from her is that it's never too late to learn, and records are important when working on a project.</p>

                    <p>This is my experience with the French Dessert Manufacturers that changed my perspective on manufacturing. This event took place on September 9th, 2020. The Owner actually come from France, oposed to the central part of the company operating in France. In this company the prominent part of the work force is the robots that make the desserts. And the owners are passinate about this company, which is a good thing because companies tend to be successful if thier leaders are passinate. It's also a very sustainable business, because people need to eat.</p>

                    <p>The Oracle Job Shadow event took place on October 7th, 2020. And this event with Oracle showed me Oracle is a software company that has locations around the world. It helps 4000 enterprises that are also global. The company invented 18,000 pieces of technology, that are all pattend. And it shows itself to be heplful because it provides tech for kids in schools during COVID-19. Zoom was made by Oracle and without it, schools wouldn't be able to teach safely during the pandemic. In addition it taught me corporate Social Responsibility is, it's a responsibility for an impact that it has the well being of it's employees and the environment. And if this field trip taught me anything, it's that change is an expectation in an organization and don't be scared to take risks.</p>

                    <p>The water treatment tour took place on October 14th, 2020. The tour showed me the process of treating the water that drops into the drain. The process begins with water flows to the plant via gravity. Once the water arives, a Bar screen and microbes are used to remove unwanted objects from the water and bacteria. A big plus from the microbes is that they give off methane. Methane can be burned and used to produce electricity. The smelly air is treated through a bio filter. And this opened my eyes to the complicated procces of treating water. </p>

                    <p> The Salesforce trip took place November 5th, 2020. The trip showed me what this company does, and most companies that help small companies sell products. This company sells technology/software to businesses and help sell product to consumers. This is what Salesforce 360 does, it is a tool used by companies to sell products. This also taught me about marketing a product, making it reach customers, and for them to get a better experience.</p>

                    <p>The Livermore Aviation Tour in 2021 led me farther into the rabbit hole. The people who built the livermore airport spent months building it, they taught me how to persevere. The people who operated it showed me developed systems such as 3D mapping systems, controlled and uncontrolled airspace and rooms to accommodate piolets who return from flights to rest. If I learned anything on this field trip it's that never burn any bridges. In other words, don't get rid of opportunities that can bring you farther, and always be ready to learn something new.</p>

                    <p>The trip to Chevron taught me that they go into more then just selling gasoline. Chevron is a huge company that gives people jobs. In Chevron, your not really restricted in what you want to do. If I learned anything at Chevron, it's that communication is key when working and project managers need to focus on one thing at a time. Another tip that I learned on this trip is  that I should never give up.</p>
