              <p>The Engineering Academy has been one of the best things that have happened to me. If it wasn't clear already, this is my work experience page and it shows the bulk of my experience in the academy. And these three years have changed me for the better. And I hope these paragraphs prove this. I really look forward to changing the world after high school.</p>

                    <p>One guest speaker that influenced me the most in the academy is probably Anthony Bagnulo from Tesla. After going to the University of Ottawa, he was inspired by a friend to go to Tesla Motors in 2012. After Tesla almost went bankrupt and some time looking for a job, Tesla came back and he became a part of it. He works in Manufacturing and Mechanical parts. If I learned anything from him, it's perseverance and have someone you look up to.</p>

                    <p>In addition, two more guest speakers that changed me were Shannah Withrow and Winne Kuag. They work with NASA and helped develop the Mars chopper, a new device that will make exploration eaiser on Mars. They both got out of school experiences with engineering. And they helped design and test aerospace equipment for NASA. If I got anything out of them, I learned that I should know my strengths, get out of my comfort zone, and communication is key.</p>

                    <p>Another speaker who influened me was Joanne Baek. She's in chemical and biomolecular engineering. After high school she was accepted by Hopkins on the east coast. And she's currently, in 2021, working on gene expression. And two things I learned from her is that it's never too late to learn, and records are important when working on a project.</p>

                    <p>In my Junior year of high school a speaker who's name was Gary Richter. He worked at a lab in Livermore after getting a degree in astrophysics and nuclear physics. Later he joined the army as a scientist who looked at terrorist's blueprints and saw what they were building. He had experience with nuclear weapons and a warhead doesn't need to be big. And warheads could be made of uranium or plutonium. These elements are almost impossible to detect on smugglers, uranium could look like anything. And this speaker taught me scientists don't need to be nerds.</p>

                    <p>In this talk, I had the privliage of meeting a former NASA engineer. He had worked in NASA during the Apollo missions. This talk helped combine the two things to get hired. You need to have manners, or be polite. In addition to that, you need to have technical enxperience.To get a good job, he stated it was important to have a healthy ratio of both.</p>

                    <p>In this talk, a person came from the company Yosemite Space. Her name was Kathleen Morse and her field is in Materials Science and Engineering. Her whole talk was about how she is trying to get today’s current technology into space. The processors within our phones haven’t been widely implemented in space yet other than the Mars helicopter. Her idea is to launch and assemble it in space rather than launch it into space in one rocket. The A.I of drone quadcopters fit the bill, they can swarm and have formation here on Earth, so why not in space? Her talk taught me so much of how our technology can be easily implemented into more technology for our future.</p>

                    <p>This is my experience with the French Dessert Manufacturers that changed my perspective on manufacturing. This event took place on September 9th, 2020. The Owner actually come from France, oposed to the central part of the company operating in France. In this company the prominent part of the work force is the robots that make the desserts. And the owners are passinate about this company, which is a good thing because companies tend to be successful if thier leaders are passinate. It's also a very sustainable business, because people need to eat.</p>

                    <p>The Oracle Job Shadow event took place on October 7th, 2020. And this event with Oracle showed me Oracle is a software company that has locations around the world. It helps 4000 enterprises that are also global. The company invented 18,000 pieces of technology, that are all pattend. And it shows itself to be heplful because it provides tech for kids in schools during COVID-19. Zoom was made by Oracle and without it, schools wouldn't be able to teach safely during the pandemic. In addition it taught me corporate Social Responsibility is, it's a responsibility for an impact that it has the well being of it's employees and the environment. And if this field trip taught me anything, it's that change is an expectation in an organization and don't be scared to take risks.</p>

                    <p>The water treatment tour took place on October 14th, 2020. The tour showed me the process of treating the water that drops into the drain. The process begins with water flows to the plant via gravity. Once the water arives, a Bar screen and microbes are used to remove unwanted objects from the water and bacteria. A big plus from the microbes is that they give off methane. Methane can be burned and used to produce electricity. The smelly air is treated through a bio filter. And this opened my eyes to the complicated procces of treating water. </p>

                    <p> The Salesforce trip took place November 5th, 2020. The trip showed me what this company does, and most companies that help small companies sell products. This company sells technology/software to businesses and help sell product to consumers. This is what Salesforce 360 does, it is a tool used by companies to sell products. This also taught me about marketing a product, making it reach customers, and for them to get a better experience.</p>

                    <p>The Livermore Aviation Tour in 2021 led me farther into the rabbit hole. The people who built the livermore airport spent months building it, they taught me how to persevere. The people who operated it showed me developed systems such as 3D mapping systems, controlled and uncontrolled airspace and rooms to accommodate piolets who return from flights to rest. If I learned anything on this field trip it's that never burn any bridges. In other words, don't get rid of opportunities that can bring you farther, and always be ready to learn something new.</p>

In Chevron, your not really restricted in what you want to do. If I learned anything at Chevron, it's that communication is key when working and project managers need to focus on one thing at a time. Another tip that I learned on this trip is  that I should never give up.</p>

          <p>This mentor program has taught me many things. My mentor’s name is Robert Benett who was a retired AT&T Wireless Network company employee. He is the one who gave me tips with my resume and my portfolio. He and I both liked science fiction and talked about colleges.</p><p>From the other mentor speakers, Adam Brown and Zoe Zannis. They talked mainly about colleges and networking. Networking is talking with other professionals in a similar field to us. Networking can give you an edge in an interview and relationships can give you a higher probability of getting hired. The mentor program has influenced me in a very positive way.</p>
