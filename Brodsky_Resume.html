                <h3>The Engineering Academy</h3>
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>The Engineering Academy has been one of the best things that have happened to me. If it wasn't clear already, this is my work experience page and it shows the bulk of my experience in the academy. And these three years have changed me for the better. And I hope these paragraphs prove this. I really look forward to changing the world after high school.</p>

              </div>
              <br>
              <p>The guest speaker that influenced me the most where the ones from Kettering University and the Python Programmer from Chevron. The one from Kettering shined a light to my future after high school. A future that might be a future in Flint, Michigan. The one from Chevron showed me that if you know what you are doing and know the logic behind it, that you can do pretty much anything with programming. These guest speakers really showed me my future and opened my eyes.</p>

                <h3>Field Trips</h3>
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>This is my experience with the French Dessert Manufacturers that changed my perspective on manufacturing. This event took place on September 9th, 2020. The Owner actually come from France, oposed to the central part of the company operating in France. In this company the prominent part of the work force is the robots that make the desserts. And the owners are passinate about this company, which is a good thing because companies tend to be successful if thier leaders are passinate. It's also a very sustainable business, because people need to eat. The Oracle Job Shadow event took place on October 7th, 2020. And this event with Oracle showed me Oracle is a software company that has locations around the world. It helps 4000 enterprises that are also global. The company invented 18,000 pieces of technology, that are all pattend. And it shows itself to be heplful because it provides tech for kids in schools during COVID-19. Zoom was made by Oracle and without it, schools wouldn't be able to teach safely during the pandemic. In addition it taught me corporate Social Responsibility is, it's a responsibility for an impact that it has the well being of it's employees and the environment. And if this field trip taught me anything, it's that change is an expectation in an organization and don't be scared to take risks. The water treatment tour took place on October 14th, 2020. The tour showed me the process of treating the water that drops into the drain. The process begins with water flows to the plant via gravity. Once the water arives, a Bar screen and microbes are used to remove unwanted objects from the water and bacteria. A big plus from the microbes is that they give off methane. Methane can be burned and used to produce electricity. The smelly air is treated through a bio filter. And this opened my eyes to the complicated procces of treating water. The Salesforce took place November 5th, 2020. The trip showed me what this company does, and most companies that help small companies sell products. This company sells technology/software to businesses and help sell product to consumers. This is what Salesforce 360 does, it is a tool used by companies to sell products. This also taught me about marketing a product, making it reach customers, and for them to get a better experience. </p>
