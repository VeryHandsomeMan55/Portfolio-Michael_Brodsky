            <p>Ever since I was young I was good at building things. For the majority of my childhood, I was interested in engineering. In my later childhood, an older friend informed me about electricity and circuits. This persuaded me into looking into electronics.</p>
           <p>When this older friend told me about Arduino boards, a circuit board that can be programmed and send power signals based on that programming. The simple act of turning a mounted LED on the board captured my imagination in ways I never thought possible, this was my first instance of programming affecting the real world and not only contained in a single computer or video game. This led me to want to pursue engineering in high school. In my years at high school I took Computer Science Principles and Principles of Engineering, and now I am in the class Digital Electronics because of that first experience with an Arduino board Electrical Engineering.</p>
           <p>Ever since Sophomore year of high school I have been exploring my other interests in Engineering that didn’t revolve around Arduino. I decided to explore further when I bought a 3D printer. This new machine allowed me to explore 3D design. After some time, I got to know the process from 3D design to a physical 3D print.</p>
           <p>Nowadays, It’s senior year and I’m looking around for colleges. I am currently looking to go to Las Positas and go to a UC later. Eventually, I want to become an Electrical Engineer at Tesla, SpaceX, or Nasa.</p>
