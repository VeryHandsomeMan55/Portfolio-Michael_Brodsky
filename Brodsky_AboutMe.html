            <p>I was born in Portland Oregon. When I was five, I moved to California. And for the past 9-ish years I have lived in the Bay Area. Ever since I was 5 I was good at building things. When someone told me about electricity and circuits I tried would have probably tried to make a simple light or something. I wanted to be a electrical engineer since. </p>
           <p> I developed a few skills over the years, like planning of what a certain project would look like. In my years at high school I took Computer Science Priciples and Principles of Engineering, and I planned to go into Digital Electronics to satisfy my passion for Electrical Engineering.</p>
           <p>Like many people, I too believe that if you work hard on something and keep coming back to it, you will succeed. So with these projects, I try, try again if something doesn't work properly. When I purchased a $300 3D printer a window opened up to me and I managed to crate a few prints.</p>
