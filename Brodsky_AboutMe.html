            <p>I was born in Portland Oregon. When I was five, I moved to California. And for the past 9-ish years I have lived in the Bay Area. Ever since I was 5 I was good at building things. When someone told me about electricity and circuits I would have probably tried to make a simple light or something. I have wanted to be an electrical engineer since.</p>
           <p>I developed a few skills over the years, like planning of what a certain project would look like. In my years at high school I took Computer Science Principles and Principles of Engineering, and I planned to go into Digital Electronics to satisfy my passion for Electrical Engineering.</p>
           <p>Ever since Sophomore year of high school I have been exploring my other interests in Engineering. I decided to explore further when I bought a 3D printer. When I got my 3D printer, it took some doing as I tried to create 3D files that my printer could read. I got the commercial edition of Fusion 360 and a slicer software from the company that made my printer. I managed to design files and get some good prints out.</p>
           <p>Nowadays, It’s senior year and I’m looking around for colleges. I am currently looking to go to Las Positas and go to a UC later. Later in life I want to work as an Electrical Engineer at Tesla, SpaceX, or Nasa.</p>
