            <p>I was born in 2004 in Portland Oregon. When I was five, I moved to California. And for the past 9-ish years I have lived in the golden state of California.</p>
           <p>Ever since I was 5 I was good at building things. If someone told me about electricity and circuits I would have probably tried to make a simple light or something. I currently have 3 older friends that affected me in so many ways. One loves Math, another is a programmer, and the last is in college to become So I have been inspired to follow mechanical engineering. Ever since I was little I wanted to become an engineer. I am also planning to join the engineering academy here in Dublin High. But at home, I am also working on some other projects, such as the pre-coded radar and a few personal repl.it projects as well as a ton of mechanical engineering projects. I also joined the Engineering Academy in Freshman year.</p>
           <p>Like many people, I too believe that if you work hard on something and keep coming back to it, you will succeed. So with these projects, I try, try again if something doesn't work properly. I also kind of want to own a mechanical engineering company in the future, that involves a little software, but mostly mechanical engineering and programming,. I also hate writing a lot.</p>
